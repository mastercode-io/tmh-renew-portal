this is a question form mye PM:

Okay, this is all really cool, my query with this set up is:
Can we use this to build forms as well?
Eg. If something started completing a form and loses internet, clicks off etc. can we save their details in the page for when they come back?
Just think about more detailed forms like trademark application

This is an architectural question so no coding, we're just exploring possible solutions if at all because this is just a static website
