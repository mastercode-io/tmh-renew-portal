I like the change in fonts and highlighting.

But the mobile screen version of the table is wrong. The idea was to keep the number text and type as is, and combine status and expiry into one
column. Where you have the combined header with the slash or maybe even into lines. And also the data itself into lines like "expired" from the
first line, and the date status on the first line, and then expire date on the second line. This way the table will be more compacted and can fit
small screen. This was the idea .
