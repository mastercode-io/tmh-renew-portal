## Scope of Service

### Our renewal service covers:

- Preparing and submitting your renewal to the relevant Intellectual Property Office.
- Acting as your authorised representative throughout the renewal process.
- Confirming acceptance once the IPO has renewed your trademark.

### This service does not include:

- Ownership transfers, name changes, address amendments, or corrections to the IPO record except for the removal of classes and/or terms where requested.
- Handling oppositions, disputes, or correspondence beyond the renewal itself.
- Renewals outside the jurisdiction selected at checkout.

**Changes such as ownership updates or class additions must be completed through a new trademark application.**

---

## Payment, Cancellations, and Refunds

- Renewal submissions will only proceed once **full payment has been received**.

- If a trademark has expired, a **£50 late renewal fee** will apply per mark (payable to the UKIPO).

- Due to the time-sensitive nature of renewals, **refunds cannot be issued** once preparation or filing has commenced, even if you later choose not to proceed.

- If you request to cancel before we begin preparing your renewal, a **£25 administrative fee** will apply.

- If the Intellectual Property Office rejects a renewal due to incorrect or incomplete details supplied by the client, **no refund will be issued**.

## Client Responsibilities

- The **accuracy of all information provided**, including trademark number, owner details, and classes, remains the responsibility of the client.

- The Trademark Helpline **cannot be held liable** for delays, errors, or rejections arising from inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete information.

---

## Confirmation of Filing

- A renewal is **not complete** until accepted by the Intellectual Property Office.

- You will receive an **email confirmation** once the renewal has been successfully processed and accepted.

---

## Additional Notes and Recommendations

- **Expired trademarks** may still be renewed within six months after expiry, subject to the UKIPO late renewal fee.

- Renewal applies only to the **jurisdiction specified at checkout** (e.g. UK). Separate renewals are required for EU or international marks.

- Clients are encouraged to consider **Active Trademark Monitoring** to safeguard their brand following renewal. While The Trademark Helpline will always endeavour to alert clients to potential infringements or upcoming renewal dates, automatic notifications are only available to clients with an active monitoring subscription or ongoing representation service in place.
